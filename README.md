# blitzkrieg
This is a "hot seat" or "pass and play" of the board game **Blitzkrieg!**. I had never played this game before I wrote the code. I created it using images and the directions available on the Board Game Geek [website for this game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/258210/blitzkrieg-world-war-two-20-minutes).

**Blitzkrieg!** is a tile laying game in which the Axis and Allied commanders take turns placing their unit tokens in one of five theaters of the war. Each theater is a tug of war in which each side battles for control. The units provide military value in the theater while many of the spaces on the board provide extra abilities such as research special weapons, bombing the opponent, and producing extra units. Each side accumulates war victory points as they win campaigns and theaters. The first side to 25 victory points wins World War 2.
